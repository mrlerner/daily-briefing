  - name: Reflux Life
    url: https://refluxlife.substack.com/feed
    notes: >
      Weekly Substack by Ann. Covers LPR management, diet, breathing exercises,
      pepsin research, and lived experience. The single best patient-focused
      source for LPR. Publishes ~1-2x per week.

  - name: The Zebra's Voice (Stacey Menton)
    url: https://staceymenton.substack.com/feed
    notes: >
      Speech pathologist covering voice/breathing/swallowing in hypermobility
      (EDS/HSD). Occasional LPR-specific posts on the reflux-hypermobility
      connection, pepsin, and sphincter dysfunction. Broader than pure LPR —
      needs keyword filtering. Publishes ~biweekly.

  # --- News / aggregators (broader coverage, keyword filtering needed) ---

  - name: Google News — Silent Reflux
    url: https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22silent+reflux%22+OR+%22laryngopharyngeal+reflux%22+OR+%22LPR+treatment%22&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
    notes: >
      Catches mainstream health articles from AARP, Cleveland Clinic,
      Prevention, Healthline, etc. Sporadic but useful for accessible
      patient-facing content.

  - name: Google News — GERD Treatment
    url: https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22GERD+treatment%22+OR+%22acid+reflux+treatment%22+OR+%22reflux+diet%22&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
    notes: >
      Broader acid reflux news. Many GERD treatments overlap with LPR
      management. Higher volume than the LPR-specific search.

  # --- Research (low volume, high signal when it hits) ---

  - name: ScienceDaily — Gastrointestinal Problems
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/health_medicine/gastrointestinal_problems.xml
    notes: >
      Aggregates university research on digestive disorders. Occasionally
      surfaces reflux studies. Needs keyword filtering.

  - name: Refluxgate Blog
    url: https://www.refluxgate.com/blog?format=rss
    notes: >
      Comprehensive LPR resource by Gerrit Sonnabend. Covers diet,
      pepsin science, sleeping position, treatment options. May not
      have a working RSS feed — if this fails, the build skips it.
